# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Spark Essentials with Scala course

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Akka HTTP with Scala](https://www.udemy.com/spark-essentials) course on Udemy. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

### How to install
- either clone the repo or download as zip
- open with IntelliJ as an SBT project

No need to do anything else, as the IDE will take care to download and apply the appropriate library dependencies.

### How to start

Clone this repository and checkout the `start` tag by running the following in the repo folder:

```
git checkout start
```

### How to see the final code

Udemy students: checkout the `udemy` branch of the repo:
```
git checkout udemy
```

Premium students: checkout the master branch:
```
git checkout master
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `start`
* `1.1-scala-recap`
* `2.1-dataframes`
* `2.10-joins-exercise`
* `2.2-dataframes-basics-exercise`
* `2.4-datasources`
* `2.5-datasources-2`
* `2.5-datasources-part-2`
* `2.6-columns-expressions`
* `2.7-columns-expressions-exercise`
* `2.8-aggregations`
* `2.9-joins`
* `3.1-common-types`
* `3.2-complex-types`
* `3.3-managing-nulls`
* `3.4-datasets`
* `3.5-datasets-part-2`
* `4.1-spark-sql-shell`
* `4.2-spark-sql`
* `4.3-spark-sql-exercises`
* `5.1-rdds`
* `5.2-rdds-part-2`

And for premium students, in addition:

* `6.1-spark-job-anatomy`
* `6.2-deploying-to-cluster`
* `7.1-taxi`
* `7.2-taxi-2`
* `7.3-taxi-3`
* `7.4-taxi-4`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
